00:40:51	Becki R. (she/her):	It works both ways, I think. It's just convention to use <-.
00:45:11	Wai-Yin:	You can use <- or = for assignment. <-  is the convention in R.  -> results in ab error.

00:09:22	Matthew Efoli:	good evening
00:09:29	Matthew Efoli:	good day
00:09:35	Vrinda Kalia:	Hello!
00:09:55	Daniel Adereti:	Hello!
00:10:04	Shannon:	Hello!
00:10:06	Daniel Adereti:	ready when you are, Matthew
00:11:40	Adeyemi Olusola:	Good evening everyone
00:28:31	Daniel Adereti:	will it be possible to sort in ascending order as well?
00:30:39	Adeyemi Olusola:	sort() should do trick
00:31:13	Adeyemi Olusola:	I have issues with my audio
00:31:39	Adeyemi Olusola:	lets try sort = ()
00:32:07	Vrinda Kalia:	I am not sure about using sort within the count function. I am only aware of using the desc argument in the sort() function
00:33:06	Daniel Adereti:	it seems the sort() has its own arguments
00:33:41	Aalekhya Reddam:	Sorry everyone, I have to head out but will watch the recording. See you all next week!
00:34:33	Shannon:	not_cancelled %>%
00:34:45	Shannon:	oops sorry, didn't finish that...
00:36:00	Adeyemi Olusola:	not_cancelled%>%
00:36:05	Adeyemi Olusola:	desc()
00:37:46	Daniel Adereti:	maybe we continue and figure it out next time?
00:37:53	Daniel Adereti:	sorry for chopping your flow!
00:38:27	Esmeralda Cruz:	maybe arrange function?
00:38:58	Esmeralda Cruz:	ok
00:44:31	Daniel Adereti:	thanks for that shortcut
00:50:23	Daniel Adereti:	Please explain "filter(rank(desc(arr_delay)) <= 10"
00:55:38	Daniel Adereti:	Thanks! noticed the same too, the descending argument does not seem to have any effect
00:56:31	Daniel Adereti:	sure!
00:56:35	Daniel Adereti:	thanks
00:58:00	Shannon:	oh, because we didn't have a rank column in the first example?
00:59:24	Daniel Adereti:	like a rank column as part of the dataset?
01:02:11	Daniel Adereti:	Thanks!
01:04:01	Shannon:	yes
01:10:42	Vrinda Kalia:	I need to leave for a meeting. Thank you so much for leading a great discussion, Matthew!
01:11:00	Shannon:	Thanks, Matthew! I liked the way you presented with both the bookdown file as well as RStudio.
01:11:09	Daniel Adereti:	Thanks Matthew!
01:11:14	Maria Eleni Soilemezidi:	Thank you for the presentation! That was very helpful! :)
01:11:15	Matthew Efoli:	Thanks
01:11:37	Maria Eleni Soilemezidi:	See you next week!
01:11:50	Esmeralda Cruz:	Thank you :) for your time Matthew
