# Introduction

The Introduction gives an overview of what the book covers.

**Learning objectives:**

- Describe a **typical data science project.**
- Explain the reasoning behind the **order of content in this book.**
- Recognize topics that are explicitly **not covered by this book.**
- **Set up an environment** in which you can learn the topics in this book.
- Describe how **code in the book** differs from **code in your console.**
- Recall ways to **get help with R code.**


## A typical data science project

![](images/data-science.png)


The steps of the data science process are:

- (1) **Import** and **tidy** data, also known as wrangling data
- (2) Understand your data with an iterative cycle of **transforming, visualizing, and modeling** 
- (3) **Communicate** your results to other humans

**Program:** Programming aids the entire process by unlocking things that wouldn't be possible to determine by hand.

## Wrangle the data

- **Import:** Get a data from a file, database, or web app into R.
- **Tidy:** Make sure each (1) *column* in your data is a *variable* and (2) each *row* in your data is an *observeration.*
- **Transform:** Filter your data to specific observations, mutate existing columns into new columns, and summarize data.

## Understand the data
- **Visualize:** Visualization is an important component of data exploration, but usually isn't very useful for automated processes.
  - The [ggplot2 book](http://ggplot2-book.org/) provides more in depth details than are covered in this book.

- **Model:** Once you know what you're asking, you can use a model to answer those questions. Models tend to scale well.

  - [Tidy Modelling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge, and the [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) package are useful resources to learn more about modelling.

## Communicate the data

- **Communicate:** Communication is a critical part of data science! It doesn't matter how good your models are if nobody knows about them.

  - ***Note:*** The second edition of this book will focus on [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) in the "Communicate" section of the book rather than [RMarkdown](https://quarto.org/) as in the first edition.
  


## The order of content in this book

- Import & Tidy are boring, so we jump to *Visualization & Transformation.*
- After that we learn to wrangle (import & tidy) data, because that is a necessary skill.
- Those baseline skills enables us to start Programming. Learning to program helps us simplify the other steps.
- We might then get into Modeling and Communicating, or we might pick those up in books that are more specifically devoted to those skills.

## Not covered by this book

- **Big data:** Working with big data is problem-specific. If you need to work with big data, other tools will be useful to learn.
- **Other programming languages:**, i.e. Python, Julia, etc. This book focuses on R. Master one tool at a time, but maybe go on to other tools later.
- **Non-rectangular data:** Honestly even a lot of things that aren't naturally table-like can be coerced to be table-like, so it makes sense to start with tables.
- **Hypothesis confirmation:** This book focuses on exploratory data analysis.

## Setting up an environment

We'll need:

- [**R**](https://cran.r-project.org/)


- [**Rstudio**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
  - Here's a useful [cheat sheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rstudio-ide.html) for the RStudio IDE


- The [**tidyverse**](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/), a collection of functions, data, and documentation that share a common philosophy of data and R programming, and are designed to work together to extend the capabilities of base R

  - `install.packages("tidyverse")` loads nine packages ([`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [`forcats`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/), [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [`lubridate`](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate), [`purrr`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/), [`readr`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/), [`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/), [`tibble`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)) that are considered the core of the tidyverse

  - 


- **Additional packages** which provide interesting datasets
  - `install.packages(
  c("arrow", "babynames", "curl", "duckdb", "gapminder", 
    "ggrepel", "ggridges", "ggthemes", "hexbin", "janitor", "Lahman", 
    "leaflet", "maps", "nycflights13", "openxlsx", "palmerpenguins", 
    "repurrrsive", "tidymodels", "writexl")
  )`

## Running R code in your console


The best way to learn R from this book is to run the code yourself. The code in the book has some slight differences from the code output you may see in your console.

- `#>`: In the book, **`#`** is used in front of the *prompt*, **`>`**, and the code following it to **comment out** the code. 


```{r eval=FALSE}
1 + 2
#> [1] 3
```

- This allows you to copy and past code from the book into your console and run it without errors.

## Conventions to refer to code

The book uses a consistent set of conventions to refer to code:

- Functions are displayed in a code font and followed by parentheses, like `sum()` or `mean()`.

- Other R objects (such as data or function arguments) are in a code font, without parentheses, like `flights` or `x`.

- To clarify which package an object comes from, we’ll sometimes use the package name followed by two colons, like `dplyr::mutate()` instead of just `mutate()`. 



## Resources for getting help

- **Pay attention to error messages.** 
  - Tidyverse error messages can be helpful in debugging, but if you can't figure out what an error is on your own, copy/paste it into Google.
- **Stackoverflow.com** *can* be helpful, but beware.
- The [**R4DS Online Learning Community**](r4ds.io/join) is a friendly Slack community with volunteer R tutors.
- When you ask for help, make a [**reprex**](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) if possible.
  - State up front what *packages* you use (we'll learn about loading packages very soon).
  - Provide (a subset of) any data you use with [`dput()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/dput).
  - Try to make your code *easy to read.* Use clean spacing, clear variable names, and comments. (Check out the [*tidyverse style guide*](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for more details)

  <summary> Meeting chat log </summary>
  
```
00:18:00	Morgan Grovenburg:	I have to leave early today. Also, I'd normally have my video on, but my kid is currently using me as a jungle gym
00:21:19	Susie Neilson:	Link to our team’s work :) https://www.sfchronicle.com/data/
00:22:40	Morgan Grovenburg:	I know what talk you're talking about
00:23:10	Wai-Yin:	Data journalism’s wikipedia article  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_journalism
00:49:59	Ryan Metcalf:	Great question Susie! I consider “Big Data” anything I can’t open in a conventional service. Using scripting languages helps with managing overhead (Cost [not monetary], time of process, processing capability, etc…).
01:00:14	Njoki Njuki Lucy:	data.table has the similar syntax as the base R package.
01:17:46	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	r4ds.io/r4ds
