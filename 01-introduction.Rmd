- Recognize topics that are not covered by this book.
- Set up an environment in which you can learn the topics in this book.
- Describe how code in the book differs from code in your console.


## A typical data science project

![](images/data-science.png)


The steps of the data science process are:

- (1) **Importing** and **tidying** data, also known as wrangling data
- (2) Understand your data with an iterative cycle of **transforming, visualizing, and modeling** 
- (3) **Communicating** your results to other humans

**Programming:** Programming aids the entire process by allowing you to automate common tasks and solve new problems with greater ease.

## Wrangle the data

Importing, tidying and transforming your data are called ***wrangling*** because getting your data in a form that’s natural to work with often feels like a fight.

- **Import:** Get data from a file, database, or web app into R. If you can’t get your data into R, you can’t do data science on it!

- **Tidy:** Tidy data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your efforts on answering questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions. Ideally each (1) *column* in your data is a *variable* and (2) each *row* in your data is an *observeration.*

- **Transform:** This comprises of narrowing in on observations of interest (e.g. filter), creating new variables that are functions of existing variables (e.g. mutate), and calculating a set of summary statistics (e.g. summarize).

## Understand & communitcate the data
- **Visualize:** A good visualization will show you things you did not expect or raise new questions about the data, or it might also hint that you’re asking the wrong question and need to collect different data. 
  - The [ggplot2 book](http://ggplot2-book.org/) provides more in depth details than are covered in this book.

- **Model:** A complementary tools to visualization, once you know what you're asking, you can use a model to answer those questions. 

- **Communicate:** Communication is a critical part of data science. It doesn't matter how good your models are if nobody knows about them.

  - ***Note:*** The second edition of this book will focus on [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) in the "Communicate" section of the book rather than [RMarkdown](https://quarto.org/) as in the first edition.
  


## The order of content in this book

- *Import* & *Tidy* are boring, so we jump to *Visualization* & *Transformation*.
- After that we learn to wrangle (import & tidy) data, because that is a necessary skill.
- Those baseline skills enables us to start *Programming*. Learning to program helps us simplify the other steps.
- Each chapter start with some motivating examples so you can see the bigger picture, and then dive into the details
- Each section of the book is paired with exercises to help you practice what you’ve learned. **Practice makes progress!**

## Not covered by this book

- **Modelling:** Modeling is super important for data science, but it’s too big a topic to cover in this book.
  - [Tidy Modelling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge, and the [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) package are useful resources to learn more about modelling.

- **Big data:** Working with big data is problem-specific. If you need to work with big data, other tools will be useful to learn.

- **Other programming languages:**, i.e. Python, Julia, etc. This book focuses on R. Master one tool at a time, but maybe go on to other tools later.


## Prerequisites

We'll need:

- Numeric literacy and basic programming skills.
  - [Hands on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) by Garrett Grolemund is a useful corequisite for this book.
- **R:**(https://cran.r-project.org/) To download R, go to [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org), the **c**omprehensive **R** **a**rchive **n**etwork 


- [**Rstudio,**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming
  - Here's a useful [cheat sheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rstudio-ide.html) for the RStudio IDE


- The [**tidyverse**](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/), a collection of functions, data, and documentation that share a common philosophy of data and R programming, and are designed to work together to extend the capabilities of base R

  - `install.packages("tidyverse")` loads nine packages ([`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [`forcats`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/), [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [`lubridate`](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate), [`purrr`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/), [`readr`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/), [`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/), [`tibble`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)), which are considered the core packages of the tidyverse


- **Additional packages** which provide interesting datasets
  - `install.packages(
  c("arrow", "babynames", "curl", "duckdb", "gapminder", 
    "ggrepel", "ggridges", "ggthemes", "hexbin", "janitor", "Lahman", 
    "leaflet", "maps", "nycflights13", "openxlsx", "palmerpenguins", 
    "repurrrsive", "tidymodels", "writexl")
  )`

## Conventions within the book


- The code in the book has some slight differences from the code output you may see in your console.

  - `#>`: In the book, **`#`** is used in front of the *prompt*, **`>`**, and the code following it to **comment out** the code. 


```{r eval=FALSE}
1 + 2
#> [1] 3
```

  - This allows you to copy and past code from the book into your console and run it without errors.


- The book uses a consistent set of conventions to refer to code:

  - Functions are displayed in a code font and followed by parentheses, like `sum()` or `mean()`.

  - Other R objects (such as data or function arguments) are in a code font, without parentheses, like `flights` or `x`.

  - To clarify which package an object comes from, we’ll sometimes use the package name followed by two colons, like `dplyr::mutate()` instead of just `mutate()`. 



## Bonus: Resources for getting help

- **Pay attention to error messages.** 
  - Tidyverse error messages can be helpful in debugging, but if you can't figure out what an error is on your own, copy/paste it into Google.
  - **Stackoverflow.com** *can* also be helpful, but beware.
- The [**R4DS Online Learning Community**](r4ds.io/join) is a friendly Slack community with volunteer R tutors.
  - Navigate to [r4ds.io/join](r4ds.io/join) to request acces to the Slack Workspace.
- When you ask for help, make a [**reprex**](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) if possible.
  - State up front what *packages* you use (we'll learn about loading packages very soon).
  - Provide (a subset of) any data you use with [`dput()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/dput).
  - Try to make your code *easy to read.* Use clean spacing, clear variable names, and comments. (Check out the [*tidyverse style guide*](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for more details)
