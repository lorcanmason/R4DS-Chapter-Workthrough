# Workflow: scripts and projects

**Learning objectives:**

- Use **keyboard shortcuts** to use the RStudio script pane efficiently.
- Understand the **script diagnostics** that the RStudio script editor provides.
- Understand how to use Rstudio and the `getwd()` function to find your **working directory.**
- Recognize the similarities and differences between **Windows paths and Mac/Linux paths.**
- Create an **Rstudio project.**

## Scripts

- The keyboard shortcut: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N`
  - a place for experimenting your R code
- Edit the script and re-run the code
- Save it as a R code file: `yourfilename.R`

<br/>

### Running Code
- The keyboard shortcuts
  - `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` to run the complete command
  - `Alt/Alt+Enter` to run the complete command and move the cursor to the next complete command code block
  - `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S` to run the script
- Tip: **Always start your script with the packages you need**

### Saving and Naming
1. File names should be **machine readable**
    - avoid spaces, symbols, and special characters. Don‚Äôt rely on case sensitivity to distinguish files.
2. File names should be **human readable**
    - use file names to describe what‚Äôs in the file.
3. File names should **play well with default ordering**
    - start file names with numbers so that alphabetical sorting puts them in the order they get used.

[More File Naming Conventions](https://huridocs.org/resource-library/organising-a-collection-of-human-rights-information/file-naming-conventions/#:~:text=To%20ensure%20that%20files%20are,%2C%20then%20month%2C%20then%20date.)


## Projects   

### What Is the Source of Truth?
- Instruct RStudio not to preserve your workspace between sessions. 
  - `usethis::use_blank_slate()`
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+0/F10` to start R
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S` to rerun the R script

### Where Does Your Analysis Live?
- `getwd()` to identify the current working directory
- `setwd()` to change the working directory (an absolute path) : **not recommended**

### RStudio Projects
![Figure 7.3: To create new project: (top) first click New Directory, then (middle) click New Project, then (bottom) fill in the directory (project) name, choose a good subdirectory for its home and click Create Project.](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/diagrams/new-project.png)

### Relative and Absolute Paths
- A relative path is relative to the working directory, i.e. the project‚Äôs home. 
- Absolute paths point to the same place regardless of your working directory.
  - Mac/Linux: a slash `/`
    - `/Users/hadley/Documents/r4ds/data/diamonds.csv`
  - Windows: two backlashes `\\`
    - `\\Users\\hadley\\Documents\\r4ds\\data\\diamonds.csv`
- You should **never use absolute paths in your scripts, because they hinder sharing.**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_hex()
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggsave("diamonds.png")

write_csv(diamonds, "data/diamonds.csv")
```

### Exercise
1. Go to the RStudio Tips Twitter account, https://twitter.com/rstudiotips and find one tip that looks interesting. Practice using it!

2. What other common mistakes will RStudio diagnostics report? Read https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/205753617-Code-Diagnostics to find out.

00:40:51	Becki R. (she/her):	It works both ways, I think. It's just convention to use <-.
00:45:11	Wai-Yin:	You can use <- or = for assignment. <-  is the convention in R.  -> results in ab error.

00:09:55	Daniel Adereti:	Hello!
00:10:04	Shannon:	Hello!
00:10:06	Daniel Adereti:	ready when you are, Matthew
00:11:40	Adeyemi Olusola:	Good evening everyone
00:28:31	Daniel Adereti:	will it be possible to sort in ascending order as well?
00:30:39	Adeyemi Olusola:	sort() should do trick
00:31:13	Adeyemi Olusola:	I have issues with my audio
00:31:39	Adeyemi Olusola:	lets try sort = ()
00:32:07	Vrinda Kalia:	I am not sure about using sort within the count function. I am only aware of using the desc argument in the sort() function
00:33:06	Daniel Adereti:	it seems the sort() has its own arguments
00:33:41	Aalekhya Reddam:	Sorry everyone, I have to head out but will watch the recording. See you all next week!
00:34:33	Shannon:	not_cancelled %>%
00:34:45	Shannon:	oops sorry, didn't finish that...
00:36:00	Adeyemi Olusola:	not_cancelled%>%
00:36:05	Adeyemi Olusola:	desc()
00:37:46	Daniel Adereti:	maybe we continue and figure it out next time?
00:37:53	Daniel Adereti:	sorry for chopping your flow!
00:38:27	Esmeralda Cruz:	maybe arrange function?
00:38:58	Esmeralda Cruz:	ok
00:44:31	Daniel Adereti:	thanks for that shortcut
00:50:23	Daniel Adereti:	Please explain "filter(rank(desc(arr_delay)) <= 10"
00:55:38	Daniel Adereti:	Thanks! noticed the same too, the descending argument does not seem to have any effect
00:56:31	Daniel Adereti:	sure!
00:56:35	Daniel Adereti:	thanks
00:58:00	Shannon:	oh, because we didn't have a rank column in the first example?
00:59:24	Daniel Adereti:	like a rank column as part of the dataset?
01:02:11	Daniel Adereti:	Thanks!
01:04:01	Shannon:	yes
01:10:42	Vrinda Kalia:	I need to leave for a meeting. Thank you so much for leading a great discussion, Matthew!
01:11:00	Shannon:	Thanks, Matthew! I liked the way you presented with both the bookdown file as well as RStudio.
01:11:09	Daniel Adereti:	Thanks Matthew!
01:11:14	Maria Eleni Soilemezidi:	Thank you for the presentation! That was very helpful! :)
01:11:15	Matthew Efoli:	Thanks
01:11:37	Maria Eleni Soilemezidi:	See you next week!
01:11:50	Esmeralda Cruz:	Thank you :) for your time Matthew
