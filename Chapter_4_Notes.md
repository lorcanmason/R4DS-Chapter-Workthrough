## Talking Points

1. The various Pans also contain additional services. You can view or modify what is available by selecting `VIEW -> Pane Layout`

1. The console can be used as a calculator

2. To find help, add ? in the front of an argument. Remember, you have to add the single quotes. Like the following:
```
?'::'
```

3. Use the tab function to autocomplete entries

4. Try to put a space between operators to allow an easier way to view the code sequence. Not a requirement for the computer...more for the human reading the code.

5. Functions can have side effects....Jon to talk about this.

6. Naming convention is good as it makes the author and the reader aware of the code's intentions.

7. Alt -> Shift -> K is amazing! Or on MAC Option -> Shift -> K

8. Does Alt Command Down Arrow copy the last line? Or is there a separate activity?
