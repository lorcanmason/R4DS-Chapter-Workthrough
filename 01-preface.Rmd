# Introduction (Preface)

The preface gives an overview of what the book covers.

**Learning objectives:**

- Describe a **typical data science project.**
- Explain the reasoning behind the **order of content in this book.**
- Recognize topics that are explicitly **not covered by this book.**
- **Set up an environment** in which you can learn the topics in this book.
- Describe how **code in the book** differs from **code in your console.**
- Recall ways to **get help with R code.**
  - Produce a minimal reproducible example or **reprex.**

## A typical data science project

![The data science process](images/data-science.png)

- **Import:** Get a data from a file, database, or web app into R.
- **Tidy:** Make sure each **column** in your data is a **variable** and each **row** in your data is an **observeration.**
- **Transform:** Filter your data to specific observations, mutate existing columns into new columns, and summarize data.
- **Visualize:** Visualization is an important component of data exploration, but usually isn't very useful for automated processes.
- **Model:** Once you know what you're asking, you can use a model to answer those questions. Models tend to scale well.
- **Communicate:** Communication is a critical part of data science! It doesn't matter how good your models are if nobody knows about them.
- **Program:** Programming can aid the entire process, and unlock things that wouldn't be possible to determine by hand.

## The order of content in this book

- Import & Tidy are boring, so we jump to **visualization & transformation.**
- After that we learn to **wrangle (import & tidy) data,** because that is a necessary skill.
- Those baseline skills enables us to start **programming.** Learning to program helps us simplify the other steps.
- We might then get into **modeling** and **communicating,** or we might pick those up in books that are more specifically devoted to those skills.

## Not covered by this book

- **Big data:** Working with big data is problem-specific. If you need to work with big data, other tools will be useful to learn.
- **Python, Julia, etc:** This book focuses on R. Master one tool at a time, but maybe go on to other tools later.
- **Non-rectangular data:** Honestly even a lot of things that aren't naturally table-like can be coerced to be table-like, so it makes sense to start with tables.
- **Hypothesis confirmation:** This book focuses on exploratory data analysis.

## Setting up an environment

We'll need:

- **R**
- **Rstudio**
- The **tidyverse** (`install.packages("tidyverse")`)
- Three **additional packages** (`install.packages(c("nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))`)

## Running R code

- Code in the book has some slight differences from code on your console.
- Don't freak out.

## Getting help

- **Pay attention to error messages.** 
  - tidyverse error messages tend to actually be helpful.
  - If you can't figure out what an error is telling you, copy/paste it into Google.
- **Stackoverflow.com** *can* be helpful, but beware.
- **r4ds.io/join** is a friendly Slack community with volunteer R tutors.
- When you ask for help, make a **reprex** if possible.
  - State up front what **packages** you use (we'll learn about loading packages very soon).
  - Provide (a subset of) any data you use with `dput()`.
  - Make sure your code is **easy to read.** Use clean spacing, clear variable names, and comments.
- [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats) twitter is super active and surprisingly friendly.

```
00:18:00	Morgan Grovenburg:	I have to leave early today. Also, I'd normally have my video on, but my kid is currently using me as a jungle gym
00:21:19	Susie Neilson:	Link to our team’s work :) https://www.sfchronicle.com/data/
00:22:40	Morgan Grovenburg:	I know what talk you're talking about
00:23:10	Wai-Yin:	Data journalism’s wikipedia article  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_journalism
00:49:59	Ryan Metcalf:	Great question Susie! I consider “Big Data” anything I can’t open in a conventional service. Using scripting languages helps with managing overhead (Cost [not monetary], time of process, processing capability, etc…).
01:00:14	Njoki Njuki Lucy:	data.table has the similar syntax as the base R package.
01:17:46	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	r4ds.io/r4ds

00:09:03	Matthew Efoli:	Good day everyone
00:09:16	Trisha Adamus(she/her):	Hi
00:09:39	Shannon:	Good morning, everyone :)
00:09:45	Adeyemi Olusola:	hello.
00:09:56	Marielena Soilemezidi:	Hi all! :)
00:10:18	Adeyemi Olusola:	who is facilitating this cohort?
00:10:38	Nico Schmidt:	I think it is Daniel, at least according to Slack
00:10:59	Shannon:	I was just going to ask. Assuming we're waiting for the host?
00:11:41	Trisha Adamus(she/her):	Has anyone participate in a cohort before? I am not sure what to expect.
00:12:20	Daniel Adereti:	Hello all, reaching out to Jon. First classes are usually introductions
00:12:35	Adeyemi Olusola:	i joined cohort 5 last week just to have a feel and it was pretty interesting
00:12:37	Matthew Efoli:	@Trisha For me, No. This is my first.
00:12:45	Shannon:	I haven't. Was wondering if today is just an intro, or if we're jumping into Ch.1
00:12:45	Nico Schmidt:	Then maybe let’s start, Daniel?
00:13:23	Nico Schmidt:	If we are jumping into Chapter 1, I have already missed my homework one time
00:14:40	Shannon:	haha, me too...
00:16:41	Nico Schmidt:	Do we do this with Cameras on or off?
00:18:14	Aalekhya Reddam:	Hello everyone, unfortunately my microphone / camera aren't working right now, hope to have it figured out by next week! I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the US. My research is in environmental epidemiology and data science is a huge part of my work
00:20:39	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	Shared notes/slides: r4ds.io/r4ds
00:26:47	Aalekhya Reddam:	Do we usually volunteer the week ahead for the next week?
00:28:53	Aalekhya Reddam:	Thank you!
00:37:01	Matthew Efoli:	bye Jon
00:37:19	Adeyemi Olusola:	let me go
00:39:04	Nico Schmidt:	Cool!
00:39:08	Nico Schmidt:	Thanks Daniel
00:39:16	Marielena Soilemezidi:	sounds good!
00:39:47	Aalekhya Reddam:	That sounds great!
00:39:50	Shannon:	Sounds good! Thank you Daniel and Adeyemi, for volunteering for next week!
00:40:12	Trisha Adamus(she/her):	Thank you!
00:40:14	Matthew Efoli:	Thank you
00:40:28	Marielena Soilemezidi:	have a great day you all! :)
