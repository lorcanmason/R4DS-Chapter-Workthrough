# Introduction (Preface)

The preface gives an overview of what the book covers.

**Learning objectives:**

- Describe a **typical data science project.**
- Explain the reasoning behind the **order of content in this book.**
- Recognize topics that are explicitly **not covered by this book.**
- **Set up an environment** in which you can learn the topics in this book.
- Describe how **code in the book** differs from **code in your console.**
- Recall ways to **get help with R code.**
  - Produce a minimal reproducible example or **reprex.**

## A typical data science project

- **Import:** Get a data from a file, database, or web app into R.
- **Tidy:** Make sure each **column** in your data is a **variable** and each **row** in your data is an **observeration.**
- **Transform:** Filter your data to specific observations, mutate existing columns into new columns, and summarize data.
- **Visualize:** Visualization is an important component of data exploration, but usually isn't very useful for automated processes.
- **Model:** Once you know what you're asking, you can use a model to answer those questions. Models tend to scale well.
- **Communicate:** Communication is a critical part of data science! It doesn't matter how good your models are if nobody knows about them.
- **Program:** Programming can aid the entire process, and unlock things that wouldn't be possible to determine by hand.

## The order of content in this book

- Import & Tidy are boring, so we jump to **visualization & transformation.**
- After that we learn to **wrangle (import & tidy) data,** because that is a necessary skill.
- Those baseline skills enables us to start **programming.** Learning to program helps us simplify the other steps.
- We might then get into **modeling** and **communicating,** or we might pick those up in books that are more specifically devoted to those skills.

## Not covered by this book

- **Big data:** Working with big data is problem-specific. If you need to work with big data, other tools will be useful to learn.
- **Python, Julia, etc:** This book focuses on R. Master one tool at a time, but maybe go on to other tools later.
- **Non-rectangular data:** Honestly even a lot of things that aren't naturally table-like can be coerced to be table-like, so it makes sense to start with tables.
- **Hypothesis confirmation:** This book focuses on exploratory data analysis.

## Setting up an environment

We'll need:

- **R**
- **Rstudio**
- The **tidyverse** (`install.packages("tidyverse")`)
- Three **additional packages** (`install.packages(c("nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))`)

Depending where you're learning, this might all be set up for you already.

## Running R code

- Code in the book has some slight differences from code on your console.
- Don't freak out.

## Getting help

- **Pay attention to error messages.** 
  - tidyverse error messages tend to actually be helpful.
  - If you can't figure out what an error is telling you, copy/paste it into Google.
- **Stackoverflow.com** *can* be helpful, but beware.
- **r4ds.io/join** is a friendly Slack community with volunteer R tutors.
- When you ask for help, make a **reprex** if possible.
  - State up front what **packages** you use (we'll learn about loading packages very soon).
  - Provide (a subset of) any data you use with `dput()`.
  - Make sure your code is **easy to read.** Use clean spacing, clear variable names, and comments.
- [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats) twitter is super active and surprisingly friendly.
