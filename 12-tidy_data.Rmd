# Tidy data

**Learning objectives:**

- Classify datasets as **tidy** or **non-tidy.**
- **Pivot** data to make it tidy.
- **Separate** and **unite** columns to make them tidy.
- Deal with **missing values** in a dataset.
- Combine functions to **tidy a dataset.**
- Recognize reasons that **non-tidy data** might be preferred in some cases.

00:13:38	Becki R. (she/her):	yes
00:28:57	Keuntae Kim:	punctuation mark also works for the numeric column name.
00:29:14	Keuntae Kim:	table4a$`1999`
00:29:16	Keuntae Kim:	I think..
00:29:47	Keuntae Kim:	you got that... haha
00:37:53	Njoki Njuki Lucy:	Thank you Jon, you just answered my question :)
00:44:12	Federica Gazzelloni:	thanks
00:51:17	lucus w:	The new {knitr} syntax allows inline chuck options. Better yet you can use yaml styling
00:52:00	lucus w:	```{r}
00:52:39	lucus w:	```{r} #| echo:FALSE ```
00:58:05	Ryan Metcalf:	I know realize‚Ä¶.I have an older version of the Print book versus the online version! Now I know why I was scratching my head!
00:58:13	Ryan Metcalf:	‚ÄúNow‚Äù
01:02:10	Keuntae Kim:	Agree. reshape/reshape seem to begin deprecated even if there are still users (like me). üòÄ
01:02:14	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	Yeah, I don't think they've done a printing since pivot_* came out.
01:13:45	lucus w:	Good job on going through the exercise but maybe randomly select some
01:13:57	Federica Gazzelloni:	agree
01:14:53	Keuntae Kim:	agree, but exercises are very interesting. they are what we usually encounter when wrangling the data in practice.
01:17:12	lucus w:	Sorry folks I have to drop.. good job Sandra!!
01:20:11	Keuntae Kim:	Excellent job Sandra! You really dive in the contents very deeply!

00:11:11	Njoki Njuki Lucy:	Hi everyone!
00:12:06	Becki R. (she/her):	Hello!
00:14:06	Susie N:	You could also just do as.numeric correct?
00:14:09	Susie N:	Just not as nice
00:19:26	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	Yup, the convert just figures out the as.* for you automatically.
00:22:11	Keuntae Kim:	https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_04_01.html
00:22:38	Keuntae Kim:	simple intro. I used this for my text mining analysis.
00:23:56	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	I use regexr.com a lot to test out regex quickly.
00:24:47	Keuntae Kim:	Thank you for the link!
00:24:52	Federica Gazzelloni:	thanks
00:50:11	Susie N:	Amazing job breaking it all down!
00:50:41	Njoki Njuki Lucy:	Thank you Sandra!
00:55:00	Becki R. (she/her):	Thanks, Sandra!
00:55:36	Keuntae Kim:	In the wide-format, it is easy to produce additional derivative variables--such as percentages?
00:56:24	Keuntae Kim:	It is because, in the wide format, each row represents one single unique observation.
00:56:58	Keuntae Kim:	Census data
00:57:03	Keuntae Kim:	is organized in the wide format.
00:57:26	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	Read vignettes here for cases where it makes sense to be wide: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/widyr/index.html
00:58:17	Federica Gazzelloni:	thanks Sandra
