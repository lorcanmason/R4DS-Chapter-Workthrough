00:38:04	Njoki Njuki Lucy:	for the linear regression model, what's the difference having the interaction effect as * or :? like y~x1*x2/ y~x1:x2
I have seen both being used but I haven't understood the difference yet ðŸ˜„
Or for one (*) we must include the main effects?
00:39:50	Njoki Njuki Lucy:	aah okay :)
00:48:05	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	* includes : plus the terms without interaction, so in most cases it makes sense to just use *:
y ~ x1*x2 = y ~ x1 + x2 + x1:x2
00:49:50	Njoki Njuki Lucy:	thanks!
01:05:06	Ryan Metcalf:	Maybe another thought towards differences between `baseR`, `tidyverse`, or `tidy models` is like having a simple toolkit for your homeâ€¦something small like Hammer, Screwdriver, and wrench set versus having an entire tool box of specific tools. It gives more granular choice for specific jobs.
01:05:28	Ryan Metcalf:	Or an entire workshop with power tools too!!!
01:06:59	Becki R. (she/her):	That's a helpful description, Ryan, thanks!
01:07:33	Ryan Metcalf:	Both kids live on their own. I hate showing up to hang a picture and realize the tool kits we gave for Xmas doesnâ€™t have a tool to make the job easier.
