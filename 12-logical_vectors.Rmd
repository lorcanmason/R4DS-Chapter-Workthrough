-   Vectors in R are the same as the arrays in C language, which are used to hold multiple data values of the same type

-   The mental model for using Logical Vectors

    -   Defining constraints on your data to answer Binary Questions

## How to use logical vectors & Boolean Algebra

![](images/14_venn_diagrams.png)

-   Combining logical vectors using Boolean algebra

    -   Venn diagram here shows the logical relations between logical vectors

### Comparison

-   numeric comparison creates logical vectors, and you can see that in the following example

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

-   There is an intermediate execution step that forma the logical vector behind the scenes when you use `filter()`

```{r}
flights |> filter(dep_time > 600 & dep_time < 2000 & abs(arr_delay) < 20)
```

-   To separate this intermediate step in it's own variable we use `mutate`

```{r}
flights |> mutate( daytime = dep_time > 600 & dep_time < 2000, approx_ontime = abs(arr_delay) < 20, .keep = "used" )
```

-   R doesn't round the float numeric value by default, but R console is rounding close number to integers

    -   To round numbers we could use `dplyr::near` function

```{r}
x <- c(1 / 49 * 49, sqrt(2) ^ 2)
typeof(x) # double
```

```{r}
print(x)
print(x,digits = 16)

```

### Identifying Missing Values

-   There is no indication what's so ever about the `NA` value if it's a logical vector, although the author says that a missing value in a logical vector means that the value could either be `TRUE` or `FALSE`
-   `TRUE | TRUE` and `FALSE | TRUE` are both `TRUE`, so `NA | TRUE` must also be `TRUE`. Similar reasoning applies with `NA & FALSE`

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(TRUE, FALSE, NA))

df |> 
  mutate(
    and = x & (NA),
    or = x | NA
  )
```

-   For identifying missing values we use `is.na(x)` function which works with any type of vector and returns TRUE for missing values and FALSE for everything else.

```{r}
is.na(c(TRUE, NA, FALSE))
#> [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE
is.na(c(1, NA, 3))
#> [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE
is.na(c("a", NA, "b"))
#> [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE
```

-   `%in%` is like asking does a set A of values is included in a set B of values

```{r}
1:12 %in% c(1, 5, 11)
```

## What are the logical summery functions we could leverage in R?

-   Main logical summaries: `any()` and `all()`

-   Numeric logical summaries: `mean()` and `sum()` specially when you want to calculate the percentages of applied constraint or condition

## Conditional Transformations using `if_else()` and `case_when()` functions

-   We see these type of transformations everywhere when we clean data

-   Its inspired by the SQL way of doing conditional transformations

-   We use [dplyr::if_else()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/if_else.html) when we have just one condition and we want to map it to only two outcomes

```{r}
x <- c(-3:3, NA)
if_else(x > 0, "+ve", "-ve", "???")
```

-   We use dplyr's `case_when()` when we want to map multiple conditions to multiple different outcomes.

```{r}
x <- c(-3:3, NA)
case_when(
  x == 0   ~ "0",
  x < 0    ~ "-ve", 
  x > 0    ~ "+ve",
  is.na(x) ~ "???"
)
```

-   Note that both [`if_else()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/if_else.html) and [`case_when()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_when.html) require **compatible** types in the output

## Summary

-   Logical Vectors is just a list of Boolean elements

-   R designed to evaluate logical vectors based on Boolean Algebra rules

-   Logical summaries is a powerful tool for summarizing data based on logic or condition

-   Conditional Transformation is tool for powering data analysis transformation process and also help you answer a Yes Or No questions about the data

01:03:05	Sandra Muroy:	I'm glad :)
01:10:01	Ryan Metcalf:	I think I just had an epiphany!!! Is this were the “Big Endian” and “Little Endian” comes in? The leading bit representing positive and negative?

00:44:15	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	The most important distinction between [, [[ and $ is that the [ can select more than one element whereas the other two select a single element.
00:47:28	Ryan Metcalf:	BRB
00:56:31	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	The tangent I obsessed on just now:

function (x, width = NULL, max.level = 3, ...) 
{
    str(x, width = get_width_glimpse(width), max.level = max.level, 
        ...)
    invisible(x)
}

(huh, "glimpse" technically comes from the {pillar} package)
01:12:09	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	> round(c(1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5))
[1] 2 2 4 4
01:14:08	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	Note that for rounding off a 5, the IEC 60559 standard (see also ‘IEEE 754’) is expected to be used, ‘go to the even digit’. Therefore round(0.5) is 0 and round(-1.5) is -2. However, this is dependent on OS services and on representation error (since e.g. 0.15 is not represented exactly, the rounding rule applies to the represented number and not to the printed number, and so round(0.15, 1) could be either 0.1 or 0.2).
