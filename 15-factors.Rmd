00:05:04	Federica Gazzelloni:	Hello
00:23:34	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	Useful: R has month.name and month.abb character vectors built in. So you can do things like y3 <- factor(month.abb, levels = month.abb)
00:35:46	Ryan Metcalf:	Open ended question for the team. If Factors are a built-in enumeration in categorical data….what if the data in review has a dictionary and the variable (column) of each record is entered as a numeral. Would a best practice to use a join or mutate to enter the text instead of a numeral.
01:00:25	Ryan Metcalf:	I’m not finding a direct definition of “level” in the Forecats text. Would it be appropriate to state a “level” in this Factor chapter is the “quantity of a given category?”
01:05:05	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	state.abb
