# Data import

**Learning objectives:**

- **Read data** from disk using the `readr::read_*()` family of functions.
- **Compare and contrast** the `read_*()` functions with the base R equivalents.
- **Parse character data** into other data types using the `readr::parse_*()` functions.
  - List the complications that can arise when parsing **numerical strings**.
  - Understand how the various **character encodings** can make it tricky to parse characters.
  - Describe the common conventions used for **date/time data**.
- **Diagnose problems** that may arise when using the `read_*()` functions.
- **Write data** to disk using the `readr::write_*()` family of functions.

## SLIDE TITLE

- ADD NEW SLIDES USING ##. 
- TRY TO KEEP THE FEEL SLIDE-LIKE
  - BULLETED LISTS, NOT PARAGRAPHS

00:07:14	Njoki Njuki Lucy:	Hi Becki!
00:11:14	Ryan Metcalf:	Sorry team, hot spot is getting an update then will switch to computer
00:11:38	Federica Gazzelloni:	Hello Ryan!
00:17:34	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	this  that    another
is     fixed  width
00:18:56	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	this, that, another
00:21:12	lucus w:	Some of the healthcare data especially in clinical trials are created using fixed width.. the datasets will usually be shipped with some kind of a data dictionary defining the amongst others, the width of each column
00:21:32	lucus w:	So parsing the files will include providing each width specification
00:21:49	Sandra Muroy:	oh interesting! thanks Lucus
00:21:59	Federica Gazzelloni:	üëçüèª
00:22:03	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	Now that you say that, I've also seen that in some of the US government data shared on data.gov.
00:22:09	lucus w:	Pretty popular in SAS language
00:22:33	Ryan Metcalf:	Excellent statement Lucas. I was initially thinking you‚Äôd have to know the data preparation process before choosing the correct read() function.
00:24:34	lucus w:	Yes.. maybe Njoki will get to it as well, but readr uses heuristic process to guess.. so it lazily just works
00:25:07	Federica Gazzelloni:	This is very interesting, I supposed to use read_csv() just with files
00:28:07	Federica Gazzelloni:	how can I use freed() to see the speed?
00:30:06	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	It's fread() not freed(). It's in the data.table package. You'd need a fairly large csv to notice the speed difference (and the latest version of readr is faster in some cases).
00:30:15	Federica Gazzelloni:	right
00:31:52	Federica Gazzelloni:	I‚Äôd like to know more about problems()
00:36:07	lucus w:	Its 1,000
00:36:20	Federica Gazzelloni:	thanks
00:41:45	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	1,000.2
00:41:52	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	1.000.2
00:43:12	lucus w:	Oh just read everything as a text and fix them accordingly later
00:43:31	lucus w:	*or
00:43:48	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	Yeah, but sometimes fixing them can be painful.
00:44:17	lucus w:	True
00:50:56	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	"you tee eff eight"
00:58:15	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	> x2 <- "\x82\xb1\x82\xf1\x82\xc9\x82\xbf\x82\xcd"
> parse_character(x2, locale = locale(encoding = "Shift-JIS"))
[1] "„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ"
00:58:37	Becki R. (she/her):	japanese
01:02:28	lucus w:	That‚Äôs probably a best way of putting it Ryan
01:05:15	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	From Wikipedia: "The objective of a heuristic is to produce a solution in a reasonable time frame that is good enough for solving the problem at hand. This solution may not be the best of all the solutions to this problem, or it may simply approximate the exact solution. But it is still valuable because finding it does not require a prohibitively long time."
01:05:44	Shamsuddeen Muhammad:	Like the def
01:05:45	Sandra Muroy:	thanks Jon!
01:12:53	Becki R. (she/her):	I need to get going. See you all next week!
01:13:14	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	We'll stop after this section!
01:13:40	lucus w:	date_names_langs()
01:14:12	lucus w:	So for Swahili it will be locale(‚Äúsw‚Äù)
01:15:08	Ryan Metcalf:	Outstanding job Lucy! Thank you everyone!

00:04:46	Federica G. (she/her):	Hello!
00:05:19	Becki R. (she/her):	Hello!
00:06:09	Becki R. (she/her):	Yes!
00:06:39	Becki R. (she/her):	I'm fine with starting
00:06:40	Federica G. (she/her):	shall we wait until 5 past?
00:06:43	Susie:	Good idea
00:06:48	Becki R. (she/her):	5 past also sounds god
00:06:50	Becki R. (she/her):	good
00:08:17	Becki R. (she/her):	How far did you all get last week?
00:09:07	Becki R. (she/her):	thanks
00:39:13	Becki R. (she/her):	It's a bit muffled
00:41:06	Ryan Metcalf:	https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/05/feather-package.html
00:41:50	Shamsuddeen Muhammad:	https://github.com/wesm/feather
00:41:52	Ryan Metcalf:	Not direct answer. It appears the feather project ‚Äúo create a standard data file format that can be used for data exchange by and between R, Python, and any other software that implements its open-source format"
00:43:58	Shamsuddeen Muhammad:	@Ryan that‚Äôs right. Also, speed is one of the concern.
00:48:20	Shamsuddeen Muhammad:	A good package I used also readtext: https://github.com/quanteda/readtext
00:50:25	Becki R. (she/her):	do you have a link to the import function information?
00:51:20	Federica G. (she/her):	you need to right click the file name and it appears
00:52:04	Sandra Muroy:	it's also located in the Environment tab
00:52:05	Federica G. (she/her):	the file name in the file pane
00:52:33	Becki R. (she/her):	Ah, thanks.
01:13:11	Ryan Metcalf:	From parse_date(): Month: "%m" (2 digits), "%b" (abbreviated name in current locale), "%B" (full name in current locale).
01:18:25	Ryan Metcalf:	readr() CRAN link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/readr.pdf
01:21:10	Federica G. (she/her):	here are the date formats: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2013/08/date-formats-in-r/
01:22:10	Federica G. (she/her):	at the bottom of the blog you find the codification
01:22:29	Sandra Muroy:	great! thank you Ryan and Federica
01:26:56	Njoki Njuki Lucy:	exercises: https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/data-import.html
